# Epidexus - Epidemic simulation

(C) 2020 Karl D. Hansen

## About
This is an agent-based simulation of epidemics using modelling how people move between locations, spreading disease at each location.

This is a work in progress and is intended for research purposes only.

This library is designed to be fast and is implemented in C++. An earlier proof-of-concept was done in python, you can find it [here](https://github.com/kdhansen/epidexus).
